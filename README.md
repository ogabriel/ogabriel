### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Gabriel, I'm a backend developer from Brazil and currently, I work at a company called [petlove](https://github.com/petlove/) as a senior software engineer.

### Working experience

I've been only working with Ruby and Elixir in my current company, mostly maintaining Elixir codebases and creating/maintaining Ruby projects. In some adverse situations, I also made some bug fixes in JS (Node).

### Things I'm currently learning

I'm really inclined towards low level programming and web development, because I really think that doing both is really fun. So I'm always exercising my C learnings, and currently I'm also learning Rust. For web development I'm already inclined towards the languages that I work at Petlove, like Ruby, Elixir and JS. But I'm also learning Golang.
